# Movie Tickets Reservation System

This side project is a backend system to make movie tickets reservation. The idea is to have movies available for reservation by users.

This project was based on [one of the roadmap.sh backend path projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects/movie-reservation-system) but my idea is to go further and implement my own ideas from the initial one.

## Project Stage

The project is currently in the early stages of development. The main features are planned, but the implementation is still in progress.
